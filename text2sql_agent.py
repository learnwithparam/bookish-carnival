The chatbot has access to an e-commerce database with information about:
- Customers and their locations
- Orders and order status (data from 2016-2018)
- Products and categories
- Sellers
- Payments
- Reviews
- Shipping and delivery information

Examples of GREETING messages:
- "Hi", "Hello", "Hey"
- "Good morning", "Good afternoon"
- "How are you?"
- Any casual greeting or introduction

Examples of IN-SCOPE questions:
- "How many orders were placed last month?"
- "What are the top selling products?"
- "Show me customer distribution by state"
- "What is the average order value?"
- "Which sellers have the highest ratings?"

Examples of OUT-OF-SCOPE questions:
- Personal questions (e.g., "What is my wife's name?", "Where do I live?")
- Political questions (e.g., "Who should I vote for?", "What do you think about the president?")
- General knowledge (e.g., "What is the capital of France?", "How does photosynthesis work?")
- Unrelated topics (e.g., "Tell me a joke", "What's the weather like?")

If the question is a greeting, mark is_greeting as true and is_in_scope as false.
If the question is ambiguous but could potentially relate to the e-commerce data, mark it as in_scope."""
